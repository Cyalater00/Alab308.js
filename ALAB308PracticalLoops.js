// === Part 1 ===//
// To begin, solve the following classic “Fizz Buzz” problem. There are a few different ways to do this - experiment with what you think is the most efficient. Once you have solved the problem, ask yourself if there could be another way; and if so, would it be better.

// for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
//   if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
//     console.log("Fizz Buzz");
//   } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
//     console.log("Fizz");
//   } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
//     console.log("Buzz");
//   } else {
//     console.log(i);
//   }
// }

// === Part 2 ===//
// A prime number is any whole number greater than 1 that cannot be exactly divided by any whole number other than itself and 1. For example, the number 5 is prime because it cannot be divided by 4, 3, or 2; it can only be divided by itself (5) and 1. Similarly, the numbers 7 and 11 are prime. As numbers become larger, determining whether or not they are prime is increasingly difficult, but loops make this process relatively easy!

let n = 4;

while (true) {
  let isPrime = true;
  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
    if (n % i === 0) {
      isPrime = false;
      break;
    }
  }
  if (isPrime && n > 1) {
    console.log(n);
    break;
  }
  n++;
}
